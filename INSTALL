INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.

You need a recent MinGW-W64 toolchain and GNU Make.
If you don't have them, install MSYS2 from Sourceforge, then launch
the MSYS shell and install the necessary packages using the command:
   "pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make" (for the 64-bit toolchain)
or "pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-make" (for the 32-bit toolchain).

To compile: use the command
   "mingw32-make -j"
or "mingw32-make -j PLATFORM=x86" (to build for 32-bit Windows)
or "mingw32-make -j all-platforms-tiny" (to build both at once).

If you install the MinGW-W64 toolchain(s) in a non-standard location,
you'll need to edit "x64_TOOLDIR" and/or "x86_TOOLDIR" in "Makefile".

Strawberry Perl is also required, for minifying the shaders. (If you use a
Perl distribution other than Strawberry Perl or if you install Strawberry Perl
in a non-standard location you should edit the hardcoded path in "Makefile").
To build without Perl, either run "make CONFIG=base" (which also enables
debugging output) or set the Make variable tiny_SHADERS to "full" in "Makefile".

To run, right-click on the ".scr" file and choose "Test", "Configure" or "Install".
