Here are the instructions for building the Polymorph screensaver from source.
See README for how to run or install the screensaver after it is built.

SETTING UP THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT.

You need a recent MinGW-W64 toolchain and GNU Make. To get them, install MSYS2
from Sourceforge, then launch the MINGW32 or MINGW64 shell and get the necessary
packages using the commands:

   pacman -Sqyu ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gcc
   pacman -Sqyu ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-make

Perl is required for minifying the shaders. If you don't want that, you can
skip the minification step (see COMPILE COMMANDS below). Otherwise, install
Strawberry Perl in the default location, or install the Perl distribution
of your choice and add its bin directory to the PATH in Makefile, or get
MINGW Perl using this command:

   pacman -Sqyu ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-perl

COMPILE COMMANDS.

To compile, enter one of these commands in the MINGW32 or MINGW64 shell:

    mingw32-make -j
    mingw32-make -j SHADERS=full
    mingw32-make -j PLATFORM=x86

SHADERS is 'minified' (the default) or 'full' (don't run the minifier).
PLATFORM is x86 (for 32-bit Windows) or x64 (for 64-bit windows).
